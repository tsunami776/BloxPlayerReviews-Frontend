# BloxPlayerReviews-Frontend

## Inspiration
I saw a lot of amazing games on Roblox and creative talent on the platform. But for reviews, I can only see a thumb up and thumb down and the number of people playing right now. I think rather than playing what other people are playing, it is more fun to find the games that suit you. 
## What it does
Websites like IGN are mainly for AAA games and well-known inde games. So I made this website for people to write their own game reviews for games on Roblox. 
## How we built it
I did this project solo. I built it based on skills I had for front-end and back-end development. For front-end, I used React to build the webpages, and for the back-end I used Express.js and MongoDB. For APIs, I used a mixture of REST and GraphQL APIs. GraphQL APIs are great for scaling and with queries, but for image uploading, I had to use REST API since that is not GraphQL's expertise. 
## Challenges we ran into
I had struggled with the AWS S3 bucket's policy. It took me a long time to figure out the correct permissions and policy settings for my project. It was also challenging to use a mixture of both GraphQL and traditional REST APIs for back-end.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud that I finally deploy the website to the web using AWS Amplify for front-end web hosting and Heroku for back-end. I am also proud that I did the whole project solo since I had to contribute everything by myself. 
## What we learned
I learned how to approach a problem and solve it using the skills I have on a very tight deadline. I also learned that debugging can take much longer time than I expected so I should allocate more time to unexpected bugs.
## What's next for BloxPlayerReviews
Since the Hackathon is short, I cannot implement all the features I had in mind. In the future, I plan to add integrate more Roblox APIs to find more gem games for users on Roblox and users can directly join the games or friends' games on my website.
